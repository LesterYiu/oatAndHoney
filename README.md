# Oat & Honey


Oat & Honey is a self-care e-commerce website created using React and Firebase. This user interface automatically updates the product section when new products are added by utilizing the Etsy API. In addition, by using the VatComply API to pull live exchange rate information, users are ensured that they are paying the correct price when the currencies are converted.
